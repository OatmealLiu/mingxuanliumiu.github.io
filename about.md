Hi! My name is Gabriel (Buo-Xuan) Huang and I am doing a PhD in machine learning, at the [Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms](https://mila.quebec/en/). My supervisor is [Simon Lacoste-Julien](http://www.di.ens.fr/~slacoste/).

I am interested in generative learning, latent-variable models, structured prediction, optimal transport, weakly-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, convex optimization, music generation, and fundamental questions of optimization and statistical learning.

Previously I did the [MVA Master's degree](http://www.math.ens-cachan.fr/version-francaise/formations/master-mva/contenus-/master-mva-cours-2016-2017-161721.kjsp?RH=1242430202531) in machine learning at École Normale Supérieure in Paris, in parallel with an engineer's degree at École Centrale Paris (now CentraleSupélec). While I was doing my master's, I worked for three years in the industry on computer vision and human activity recognition. Before that, I did classe préparatoire at Lycée Hoche in France.
