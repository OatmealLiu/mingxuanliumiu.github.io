## Thin-8 dataset

The Thin-8 dataset consists of 1585 grayscale handwritten images of the digit 8, with resolution 512x512.

16 people were asked to draw the digit 8 about 100 times using a pen on a tablet PC running Microsoft Windows.

Thin-8 was collected in October 2017 at the [Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms](https://mila.quebec)
